something i cannot express

1. 你需要累加这些量，然后在没一秒的最后跟前一个最优值进行比较。

you need to accumulate these values and compare the end state of each second with the previous second.

how can i decide if i need to solve this problem again in the future, and why i need to do that,

if i really understood it, i think you dont need to do it for a lot of times or mayber you just need several minutes to do it again, but what is important is the way you think about those problems, i mean the patter stuff

people can be divided into groups just like leetcode problems can be divided into problems.
