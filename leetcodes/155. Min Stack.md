So the idea here is that, just use one stack to store all the number and use a variable to store the current min value.


for example

| the number you pushed |     |     |
| --------------------- | --- | --- |
| -2                    |     |     |
| 0                     |     |     |
| -3                    |     |     |
| 3                     |     |     |


if you push -2 into this stack, it will have a 0

stack 0 -> null
min = -2

then if you top, we need to return peek + min = 0 + -2 = -2

if you push 0 into this stack, it will become
stack 0 -> 2
min = -2

then if you top, we need to return peek + min = 0

if you push -3 into this stack, it will become
stack 0  -> 2 -> -1
min = -3;

then if you top, we need to return min = -3, because top is less than 0,

then we start to pop
since pop is -1, we pop and update the min to be -3 - -1 = -2


----

So the idea here is that

push -2, 0, -3

when we push, if it's empty, just push
min = x;
else
push the difference of x and min

for example, the first number is -2

you push 0 into it, min = -2,
then if you want to pop, just pop the min + pop = -2 + 0
if you top, which is peek here, you
top = 0, you return min,
for get min, you just return min

you push the next number 0 into it,

actually what you push is x-min = 0 - -2  = 2,

pop you pop
top you need to return top + min = 2+-2= 0;
get min, you still get -2

next number -3,
you actually push (-3 - -2 ) = -1, since it's less than 0. so min = -3,

top return min because peek is -1 less than 0,
get min, you get -3





```
public class {

  long min;
  Stack<Long> stack;

  public MinStack(){
    stack = new Stack();
  }

  public void push(int x){
    if(stack.isEmpty()){
      stack.push(0l);
      min = x;
    } // end of if
    else{
      stack.push(x-min);
      if(x<min){
        min = x;
      } // end of if
    }

  }

  public void pop(){
    // basically you just need to pop the stack,
    // but you need to update the min as well

    if(start.isEmpty()){
      return;
    } // end of if

    long p = stack.pop();
    if(p<0){
      min = min - p;
    } // end of if


  }

  public int top(){
    long p = stack.peek();


}





}

```
