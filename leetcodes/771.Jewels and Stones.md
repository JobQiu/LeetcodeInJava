so the problem here is, there are some letter represents jewels and you need to search a string and determine how many jewels in this string,
for example,

J = 'aA', S = 'aAAbbb'
then there are 3 jewels in the S

So my first solution, is to store all those jewels in to a hashset, so that we can search using O(1), and the time complexity is o(n) where n is the length of S.

```


// 0. filter some easy cases,
if(J == null || S == null || J.length() == 0 || S.length() == 0){
    return 0;
}

// 1. use a hashset to store the jewels

Set<Character> j = new HashSet();
for(char c: J.toCharArray()){
    j.add(c);
}

int count = 0;

for(char c: S.toCharArray()){
    if(j.contains(c)){
        count++;
    }
}
return count;

```

While there is a better solution,

using charat and index of

```

int count = 0;
for(char c : S.toCharArray()){
  if(J.indexOf(c)!=-1){
    count++;
  }
}

return count;

```

what is the time complexity of indexOf?
