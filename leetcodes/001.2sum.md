class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {



    }
}

---

so the first idea is

---

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].


---

so one method is to store them in a hash map, and then you can just search it, with o1,
but it tooks o n to store all these values.
and also i need to return the index,

is that possible there is no solution for this problem.
we assume there is a solution.

the time complexity of this method is o(n), space is o(n) for the hashmap

```
public int[] twoSum(int[] numbers, int target) {
    int[] result = new int[2];
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<Integer, Integer>();
    for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
        if (map.containsKey(target - numbers[i])) {
            result[1] = i + 1;
            result[0] = map.get(target - numbers[i]);
            return result;
        }
        map.put(numbers[i], i + 1);
    }
    return result;
}

```

this is the main stream solution.
