// okay lets check the logic here again,

so if the prev is not null, this means we've met some nodee of hte next level before, and

// for example cur.left is the first element of the next level, then head = cur,left.
pre = cur.left
since left is not null.
next left, what will happen, pre .next = cur.left, and then prev = cur.left, ok good, we can do the same thing to the right.
