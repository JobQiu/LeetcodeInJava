the problem we want to solve here is to write a function to compute the next state of the game of life.
[
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,1],
  [1,1,1],
  [0,0,0]
]

->

[
  [0,0,0],
  [1,0,1],
  [0,1,1],
  [0,1,0]
]

if a cell is current live, which means it's 1 here, if there are less than 2 live cell around, it will die, if there are more than 3 live cell around, it will die,

2-3 is safe,

for a dead cell, if there are 3 live cell around, it will revive.

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population..
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
