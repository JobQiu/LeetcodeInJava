There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the k colors. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x k cost matrix. For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color 0; costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color 2, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.

Note:
All costs are positive integers.

Example:

Input: [[1,5,3],[2,9,4]]
Output: 5
Explanation: Paint house 0 into color 0, paint house 1 into color 2. Minimum cost: 1 + 4 = 5;
             Or paint house 0 into color 2, paint house 1 into color 0. Minimum cost: 3 + 2 = 5.

Could you solve it in O(nk) runtime?

The idea here is to use dp, and each time we store the smallest one and the second smallest one and their index,

so as to the next row, we


take this as an examples

1  5 3

so the samllest one is 1, and its index = 0. the second smallest one is 3

// deal with some corner cases
if(A == null || A.length == 0){
  return 0;
  } // end of if

int n = A.length;
int k = A[0].length;

int min = -1; min2 = -1;

for(int i = 0; i < n ; i++){

int last1 = min1, last2 = min2;
min1 = -1, min2= -1;
for(int j = 0; j < k ; j++){

  if(j == last1){
    A[i][j] += last1<0?0:A[i-1][last2];
    } // end of if
    else {
      A[i][j] += last2<0?0:A[i-1][last1];


    }

    if(min1 <0 || A[i][j]<A[i][min1]){
      min2 = min1; min1 = j;
      } // end of if
      else if (min2<0 || A[i][j]<A[i][min2]){
        min2 = j;

      }



  } // end of for j

  } // end of for I

return A[n-1][min1];
