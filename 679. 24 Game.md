write some ideas here so that you can continue to try this tomorrow,
every push at least three problems into the queue, and solve at least 3 before you leave.



```

boolean res = false;
final double eps = 0.001;

public boolean judgePoint24(int[] A) {

  List<Double> list = new ArrayList();
  for(int n : A){
    list.add(A);
  }

  helper(list);
  return res;
}

private void helper(List<Double> A){

  if(res){
    return;
    } // end of if


}


```
