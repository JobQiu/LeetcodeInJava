1. use a boolean to store the result
2. use eps to avoid divide by 0

3. build a helper function, to

take this as an example 4, 1, 8, 7

iterate i from 1  8    7
iterate j from 4, 4 1, 4 1 8

for example for 1 and 4, iterate every combination of these two numbers and put their result for the next iteration,

for example 1*4 and 8 7, three number to get 24,

if there are only one number, test if it's 24.

if so return true;

write some ideas here so that you can continue to try this tomorrow,
every push at least three problems into the queue, and solve at least 3 before you leave.



```

boolean res = false;
final double eps = 0.001;

public boolean judgePoint24(int[] A) {

  List<Double> list = new ArrayList();
  for(int n : A){
    list.add(A);
  }

  helper(list);
  return res;
}

private void helper(List<Double> A){

  if(res){
    return;
    } // end of if


}


```
