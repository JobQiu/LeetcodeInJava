about my future, I just know several friends who make easy money, and some of us who worked very hard, but maybe they are just some tools man.

So as to me, I still want to start some companies when I was old enough, know enough about the business.

But just find out a lot of problems about myself.
Like I cannot break my circle. I cannot speak in front of other people and I always have a lot of excuses and i dont like to be like this, i mean if this is a chinese course, i will definitely be more confident, but this is an english course, so I have to be good at my speaking if i want to advance. So there are several solutions, ask people whose speaking is much better than u, ask for some help.

and secondly how to be more brave.
Practice makes perfect, so after this period I really need u to `针对性` practice. That means a lot to me, and then the logic to speak, and some other things like make a lot of friends.
