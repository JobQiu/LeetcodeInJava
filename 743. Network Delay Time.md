 // the basic idea here is to
 // for example, you start from node 3.

// you cam calculate the time from 3 to all other nodes

|     |     |        |
| --- | --- | ------ |
| 3   | 1   | 10 sec |
| ... | ... | ...    |
| 3   | 6   | 5 sec  |


so you just need to return the maximum time in this table.

// so what is dijkstra algorithm?
